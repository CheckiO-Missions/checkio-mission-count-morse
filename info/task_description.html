<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Everyone and their brother has surely heard of Morse codes, the classic encoding of text into binary symbols canonically denoted with dots and dashes. However, this coding is technically ternary since the pause between two letters is really a separate symbol, analogous to how whitespace between the words you are now reading are characters just the same as those with visible glyphs. Without the pauses separating the individual codewords, the same message could theoretically be decoded in exponentially many different ways. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Your function receives the <b>message</b> without pauses along with the <b>letters</b> whose encoding originally produced that <b>message</b>. Your function should count how many different permutations of those <b>letters</b> produce that exact same <b>message</b>. Each individual character is guaranteed to appear in letters at most once, all symbols and letters must be used.

        One of the way of solving is to use recursion, aided by a tasty serving of some <b>@lru_cache</b> magic to prevent your recursion from redundantly exploring identical subproblems multiple times.
